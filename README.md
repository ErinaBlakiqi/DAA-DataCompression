Using Huffman Coding and Run-Length Encoding
# Data Compression Tool: Huffman Coding and Run-Length Encoding

This project implements a data compression tool that uses a combination of **Huffman Coding** and **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** to compress and decompress text data. The tool is implemented as a Python-based command-line application, a Streamlit web app, and a Tkinter desktop application, providing flexibility in how users can interact with it.

## Project Overview

The tool leverages two popular compression algorithms:

1. **Huffman Coding**: A lossless data compression algorithm that uses variable-length codes for encoding characters, based on their frequency of occurrence in the input data.
2. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**: A simple form of compression where consecutive data elements (runs) of the same value are stored as a single data value and its count.

The combination of these two techniques enables efficient text compression with high potential for reducing data size.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (for desktop app)
- `streamlit` (for web interface)
